# The udemy_course
The course covered in the beginning the basic concepts of machine learning and neural networks. The platform used in this course is **Tensorflow**. I find Tensorflow well documented, easly understandable deep learning platform. with no preair knowledge of neural network or Tensorflow, i was able to do examples by myself. 

**example_random-data**

Trian simple neural network model on randomly generated data. The weights and biases are also randomly gerated. 

**example_MNIST**
