# Minor_Applied_Data_Science
Welcome to my portfolio on the tasks I have done and been part of during my minor Applied data science at the Hague University of Applied Sciences. 

I am a third year Civil Engineering student at The Hague university of Applied Science. I am interested in statistics and probability related problems. 

The reason I choose this minor is because there is more data available in the civil engineering sector now than ever before. Data science is the most effective way in gaining insight in large amount of data. I would like to combine the knowledge I gained during my minor with my civil engineering major.
